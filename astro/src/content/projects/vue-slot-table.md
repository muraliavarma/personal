Vue Slot Table is a highly flexible and unopinionated table component for Vue 2 that leverages the power of scoped slots for maximum customization. Designed for performance and extensibility, it allows developers to define custom templates for columns, headers, and cells, making it easy to build complex tables with sticky columns, grouped headers, and custom cell rendering—all without imposing any CSS or design constraints.

**Key Features:**
- Per-column templating and styling using Vue's slot system
- Support for column group headers and sticky columns
- Custom cell rendering and row event handling
- Functional component design for high performance
- No built-in CSS—fully customizable by the user
- Works seamlessly with native table features

**Impact:**
- 100+ stars and 60+ forks on GitHub
- Used by developers seeking a lightweight, flexible alternative to heavy table libraries
- Open source under the MIT license
