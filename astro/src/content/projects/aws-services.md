Over the last couple of years, I have worked on multiple products within Amazon Web Services.

At SAP.IO, I monitored the usage of our unmanaged Kubernetes Cluster (before EKS) and reduced costs by 60% by downscaling them using kops.

I also worked through the high pressure process of restoring the latest EBS snapshot of an accidentally deleted volume that was attached to a super important EC2 node.

At Zynga, I oversaw the migration plan for moving volatile keys from internal Memcached solution to AWS Elasticache. I also wrote AWS Lambda functions in Python to handle automatic replacement of bad nodes.

I have also worked on Amazon SES templates and workmail integration in my side projects.
