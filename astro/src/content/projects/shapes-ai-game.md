In this project, we created a game where we controlled a simple shape that required us to solve puzzles. The interesting thing was that some puzzles were only partially solvable by the player, the remaining part required a companion AI.

This AI would analyze the expected final state and the data it has at hand and figure out all possible ways in which it can succeed and then use the most optimal solution. If player changes state during this time, the AI would recompute its state.

Image here shows a screenshot of the player shape on its route to solve one of the puzzles. After this, the AI would have gone on to solve the rest of the puzzle
