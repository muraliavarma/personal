In this project, we created different types of tree structures using L-systems. In a forest, many such trees compete for light and fight against gravity (resulting in sagging trees due to "geotropism")

We used Three.js for rendering the forest and a Turtle to draw the trees using grammar rules from the L-system theory.

Image here shows a screenshot of a snapshot of the forest after a few iterations of randomized seed distribution. Redder colors are older trees and generally taller. They grow and die, leaving the younger ones to thrive after a certain time, resulting in a very dynamic environment. Try out the Live Demo link above to see it in action
