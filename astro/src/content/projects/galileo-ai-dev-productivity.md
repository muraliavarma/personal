As Senior Staff Full Stack Engineer at Galileo Financial Technologies, I actively contribute to the "Month of AI" initiative, a program dedicated to exploring AI tools to boost developer productivity and satisfaction. My work includes evaluating and establishing best practices for AI tools (notably Cursor IDE), and rapidly delivering production-ready features such as a Next.js "Notes" app using Figma imports and AI-assisted coding.

A key highlight is architecting and developing the "Config Assist" AI chatbot PoC, which brings natural language capabilities to the Galileo Console. This solution leverages AWS Bedrock (LLM), a Python Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, and a Next.js Vercel AI SDK frontend to enable users to query, compare, and understand 650+ product configuration parameters using natural language. The PoC demonstrated a 75% reduction in complex query time and an 80% decrease in config promotion errors, with a clear path to production readiness.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Led adoption and guideline creation for AI tools (Cursor IDE) used by 10+ developers
- Developed a production-ready "Notes" feature in Next.js with AI-assisted workflows
- Collaborated with senior management on feedback and success metrics for the initiative
- Architected and delivered the "Config Assist" PoC chatbot, integrating AWS Bedrock, FastMCP, and custom embeddings
- Designed UI features for summarization and comparison of complex configurations
- Outlined expansion and next steps for the PoC, sharing technical knowledge with peers

**Impact:**
- Reduced development time for new features by 50% using AI-assisted workflows
- Improved developer satisfaction and productivity (targeting 15%+ MR throughput increase)
- Enabled users to analyze complex configurations in minutes instead of hours
- Demonstrated technical leadership in rapidly applying cutting-edge AI and web technologies
