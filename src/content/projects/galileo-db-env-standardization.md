At Galileo Financial Technologies, I initiated and led a transformative test database infrastructure modernization project that fundamentally changed how UX development teams worked with data. The project addressed critical challenges in the development pipeline, enabling efficient, isolated, and reproducible environments for multiple squads and local development on modern hardware.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Architected and implemented Oracle Container Database (CDB) and Pluggable Database (PDB) infrastructure within Kubernetes
- Developed automated scripts and workflows for rapid creation/teardown of test environments
- Created proof of concept for Oracle database compatibility with ARM-based MacBook systems
- Built custom Oracle Docker images with company-specific schemas and seed data
- Implemented visual testing capabilities in development pipelines
- Established automated environment provisioning integrated with CI/CD
- Designed AWS EFS-based storage for persistent database management
- Authored maintenance tools and documentation for schema/seed data updates

**Impact:**
- Reduced environment setup time by 75% and testing environment setup by 95%
- Enabled concurrent development for 20+ developers across 3 squads
- Achieved 100% compatibility with ARM-based MacBook systems
- Reduced feature delivery time from weekly to daily releases
- Reduced regression issues by 70%
