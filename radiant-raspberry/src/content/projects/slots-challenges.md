Designed and implemented the core logic in PHP for a framework in Zynga Hit It Rich! Slots game that presents players with tasks/challenges which when completed grants them rewards. This has been extended and used for multiple features and events, all configurable from a single feature-rich admin page made in React JS and Redux.

Since these features are timed events, servers were usually under heavy load during this time. To mitigate this, I implemented a caching strategy for storing the latest configuration files in each web server as well as in-memory.
